## What is Dogebox 
Dogebox is a Linux OS with a web-based management interface and permission-based routing and container system designed to 
provide a platform and DRE (Dogecoin Runtime Environment) for building services and apps on top of the Dogecoin blockchain.

Services & applications packaged for Dogebox are called 'pups', these are standard linux services that are executed in
isolated containers, with access to other 'pups' and the Dogecoin blockchain via ACL/Permission controlled internal routing.

## Current Status

**As a pre-alpha preview, these images are provided for people to get an idea of how the system works, while we push to
complete all the 'glue' that brings the whole system together. We expect rapid acceleration of functionality over the 
next two weeks (now - 20th Sept 2024).**

Expect that these images will be rapidly replaced as we get closer to a complete working system! 

### Functionality in current nightly:

- **Builtin: dogeboxd / DKM (doge key manager) running**
- *Setup Dogebox & configure password / master keys*
- *Install a 'test-pup' and stop/start it*


### Functionality end of week:

- **Builtin: Dogenet running** (Dogebox meta-gossip-protocol service for node communication)
- **Builtin: Internal Pup API Router** (Pups talking to eachother)
- *SPV node pup available*
- *Core node pup available*
- *GigaWallet pup avaialble*

### Functionality remaining (end Sept):

- *Network Map pup available*
- *Identity pup available*
- *dPanel: pup realtime logging*
- *dPanel: resolve API deps when installing pups*
- **ARM builds available**

## Getting It

Builds are available on our [Github Releases](https://github.com/dogeorg/dogebox/releases) page.

> [!NOTE]
> All releases currently have hardcoded credentials until we work on SSH management. These are `shibe:suchpass`

## Running It

Currently, only "virtual machine" images are being released. We plan to release ARM (`aarch64`) and `x86_64` compatible hardware images over the next couple of weeks.

See details below for specific setups:

<details>
  <summary>Running in QEMU</summary>

1. First, grab the latest QEMU release.

2. Launch the image with the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
-drive file=dogebox.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
-m 4G \
-smp 2 \
-nographic \
-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
-device virtio-net,netdev=net0
```

<details>
  <summary>Running in VMWare</summary>

TODO :)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Running in Virtualbox</summary>
