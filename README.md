## What is Dogebox 
Dogebox is a Linux OS with a web-based management interface and permission-based routing and container system designed to 
provide a platform and DRE (Dogecoin Runtime Environment) for building services and apps on top of the Dogecoin blockchain.

Services & applications packaged for Dogebox are called 'pups', these are standard linux services that are executed in
isolated containers, with access to other 'pups' and the Dogecoin blockchain via ACL/Permission controlled internal routing.

## Getting It

Builds are available on our [Github Releases](https://github.com/dogeorg/dogebox/releases) page.

> [!NOTE]
> All releases currently have hardcoded credentials until we work on SSH management. These are `shibe:suchpass`
