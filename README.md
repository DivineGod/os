## What is Dogebox OS?

Dogebox OS is a specialized Linux distribution built on NixOS that provides a secure, containerized runtime environment for Dogecoin services and applications. This repository contains the NixOS flake configuration and build system for creating Dogebox OS images.

### Key Features

- **Built on NixOS**: Leveraging the power of declarative, reproducible system configuration
- **Container-based Architecture**: Applications (called "Pups") run in isolated NixOS containers
- **Secure by Design**: Integrated authentication through the Doge Key Manager (DKM)
- **Multiple Platform Support**: Build images for x86_64, ARM64, and specific hardware like NanoPC-T6
- **Web-based Management**: User-friendly interface for system and application management

## System Components

Dogebox OS integrates several key components:

### Core Services

- **[dogeboxd](https://github.com/dogebox-wg/dogeboxd)** - The system manager service that orchestrates all Dogebox operations
- **[dpanel](https://github.com/dogebox-wg/dpanel)** - Web-based management interface for Dogebox
- **[dkm](https://github.com/dogebox-wg/dkm)** - Doge Key Manager for cryptographic operations and authentication

### Additional Resources

- **[dogebox-nur-packages](https://github.com/dogebox-wg/dogebox-nur-packages)** - Custom NUR packages for Dogebox

## Getting Started

### Downloading Dogebox OS

Pre-built images are available on our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dogeorg/dogebox/releases) page.

### Running Dogebox OS

Detailed installation and usage instructions for various platforms can be found at **[dogebox.org](https://dogebox.org)**.

Currently supported platforms:
- QEMU/KVM (x86_64 and ARM64)
- ISO images for bare metal installation
- NanoPC-T6 (ARM64 hardware)

> [!NOTE]
> Current releases use default credentials: `shibe:suchpass`. You will be required to change the password on first login.

```

### Flake Structure

The flake provides several outputs:

#### Packages
- `iso` - Bootable ISO images (x86_64, aarch64)
- `qemu` - QEMU/KVM disk images (x86_64, aarch64)
- `t6` - NanoPC-T6 specific image (aarch64)

This provides all necessary tools for building and testing Dogebox OS images.
